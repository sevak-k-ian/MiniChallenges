"""
Python Project: Analyze Text with Python
Task: Write a Python script that takes a user-inputted block of text and analyzes it by calculating the number of characters, words, and sentences. Additionally, determine the most frequently used word and calculate the average word and sentence length.
The program should output text statistics, including:
- Total Characters
- Total Words
- Total Sentences
- Most Frequent Word
- Average Word Length
- Average Sentence Length
